2.Navigates to the SauceDemo login page.
3.Enters a valid username and password.
4.Logs into the application.
5.Selects two products (including Sauce Labs Backpack).
6.Adds them to the cart.
7.Validates that the first product name and prices in the cart are correct.
8.Captures a screenshot of the cart page for verification.
